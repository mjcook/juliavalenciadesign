  <h2>
    <span style="color:#A64166; font-style: oblique; font-weight: 400;">
    “He looked at her as a man looks at a faded flower he has plucked, in which he can barely recognize the beauty that made 
    him pluck and destroy it”
    </span>
</h2>

  <p>
    This quote from the novel is what inspired the floral symbolism and theme throughout the jacket design. 
    My goal was to showcase the evolution of Anna’s character throughout the story with floral symbolism and imagery. 
    At the start of the novel, Anna is seen as a beautiful, sophisticated, and respected wife and mother, 
    which is illustrated by the gorgeous, elegant flowers on the front cover. 
    When Anna begins having an affair and rejecting her marriage, her downward spiral begins- she is now seen as a damaged and 
    scandalous woman who is scorned by society, her family, and eventually, her lover, which is illustrated on the back cover 
    with the dark, decaying flower and the quote about her destruction.

    <h3><span style="color:#DDB0A4">PURPOSE</span></h3>
    
    <p>
      Penguin Random House, an American book publisher, is launching the “Fall in love with a classic” campaign to market classic novels to a younger demographic of readers. 
      The campaign will consist of creating modern book cover editions of classics and promotional materials, including book shop signage and a social media video, starting with Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy.
    </p>

    <h3><span style="color:#DDB0A4">PROCESS</span></h3>
    
    <p>
      Anna Karenina, a 900-page Russian-translated novel, was intimidating at first glance, but I read this novel over one weekend and couldn’t put it down. I was captivated by the family drama and dark twists and turns. 
      Classics can be seen as boring and uninteresting to many young readers; therefore, the strategy of the Anna Karenina media pieces is to highlight the drama and dark intrigue of the novel. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The headline ‘drama, scandal, secrets’ is a new, exciting way to market the classic Russian novel. “Fall in love with a classic” offers an exciting, promising perspective on reading classics. 
      The black and rose colors, beautiful and elegant flowers, and the classic typography style creates a striking, modern, and engaging look for this dark classic novel that will captivate young readers.
